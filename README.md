# Steam-app UI
> [View published demo](https://ic3top.github.io/Steam-app)

### Concepts that I want to point out
1. UI written in Angular
2. JWT auth used (token and expiration date saved in localStorage)
3. Every component use onPush change detection
4. Every feature module lazy-loaded
5. Angular-material library used (all components come from shared module)
6. Airbnb eslint config (for ts)
7. Backend and frontend parts are on different domains
